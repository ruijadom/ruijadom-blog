## Introduction
Many React applications need a **global state** shared between components without prop drilling or adding heavy dependencies like Redux or Zustand. But is it possible to create a simple, performant, and modern global store **using only React**, without external libraries or even Context API?

Besides being a practical solution, this is also a great opportunity to understand how popular state management libraries work under the hood, since many of them use React's native APIs.


## Why Avoid Context or External Libraries?

* React Context can cause unnecessary re-renders across the whole component tree consuming it, especially with frequent state changes.
* Libraries like Redux and Zustand add external dependencies and complexity.
* We want something simple, lightweight, and using modern React APIs.


## Creating Our createStore Function

Let's create a function `createStore` that generates a global store. It will have:

* Private internal state
* Functions to read (`get`), update (`set`), and subscribe (`subscribe`) to state changes
* A React hook `useStore` to consume reactive slices of the state

Here's the code:

```ts
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react'

type Listener = () => void

export function createStore<T extends object>(initialState: T) {
  let state = initialState
  const listeners = new Set<Listener>()

  function get() {
    return state
  }

  function set(partial: Partial<T> | ((prev: T) => Partial<T>)) {
    const update = typeof partial === 'function' ? partial(state) : partial
    state = { ...state, ...update }
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener())
  }

  function subscribe(listener: Listener) {
    listeners.add(listener)
    return () => listeners.delete(listener)
  }

  function useStore<U>(selector: (state: T) => U) {
    return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, () => selector(state))
  }

  return { get, set, subscribe, useStore }
}
```

## How to Use the Store

Create a simple counter store in `store/counter.ts`:

```ts
import { createStore } from '../lib/store'

type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

export const counterStore = createStore<CounterState>({
  count: 0,
})
```

Then in your React component consume it like this:

```tsx
import { counterStore } from './store/counter'

export function Counter() {
  const count = counterStore.useStore(state => state.count)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => counterStore.set(s => ({ count: s.count - 1 }))}>–</button>
      <button onClick={() => counterStore.set(s => ({ count: s.count + 1 }))}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This pattern provides:

* Global access to state without passing props
* Components only re-render when the selected slice changes
* A simple, Zustand-like API

## Global State

This store lives outside the React tree:

* The state is a singleton: there is only **one instance** shared globally.
* No need for a Provider wrapper.
* Cannot create multiple isolated instances of the same store.

If you need isolated scopes, combine with React Context or create store factories.

## Why This Is a Great Opportunity to Understand Popular Stores

Besides being simple and efficient, this pattern is a great chance to see **how popular global state libraries work under the hood**.

For example, **Zustand** and modern **Redux** internally use `useSyncExternalStore` to connect their stores to React efficiently and selectively. By building your own store with this API, you get hands-on understanding of the core techniques used in widely adopted libs.

## Advantages and Caveats

### Advantages

* Zero external dependencies
* Simple and intuitive API
* Avoids full tree re-renders caused by Context
* Built on official, stable React API

### Caveats

* Global singleton state can complicate multi-tenant apps or isolated testing
* Persistence and middleware must be implemented manually
* State immutability is important to avoid bugs

## Next Steps

You can extend this pattern to:

* Create multiple stores (`userStore`, `settingsStore`)
* Add persistence with `localStorage`
* Implement middlewares for logging or DevTools
* Create advanced selectors to optimize re-renders

## Conclusion

With just a few lines and the right React API, you can create a modern, lightweight, performant global store without external dependencies. This pattern fits many React apps perfectly.
